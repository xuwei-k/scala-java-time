This project provides an implementation of the `java.time` package, a date and time library that was added in Java 8.
The implementation is based on the original BSD-licensed reference implementation (before it was contributed to OpenJDK).

#### Usage

The *scala-java-time* library is currently available for Scala (JVM, version 8 and later) and Scala.js (JavaScript).
Both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12 (2.12.0-M5 and later) are supported.

To get started with SBT, add one (or both) of these dependencies:

- `libraryDependencies += "io.github.cquiroz" %   "scala-java-time" % "2.0.0-M6"` (for Scala)
- `libraryDependencies += "io.github.cquiroz" %%% "scala-java-time" % "2.0.0-M6"` (for Scala.js, [Scala.js plugin](http://www.scala-js.org/tutorial/basic/#sbt-setup) required)

#### Documentation

See the [documentation](http://cquiroz.github.io/scala-java-time/)
